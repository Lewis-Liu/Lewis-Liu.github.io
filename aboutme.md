title: About me
---

During my PhD in Physics at [University of Salento](https://www.unisalento.it/),
Italy, I studied [exoplanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet) with the
method of [gravitational
microlensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing).  After
that, I got a Postdoctoral position at [University of
Lâ€™Aquila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_L%27Aquila), Italy,
working on the [GERDA Particle Physics
experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium_Detector_Array). I then had
a short but intense experience working in industry as software consultant for a
company in the defence sector.

Now, I enjoy my days writing software at [University College
London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk), UK, as a member of the [Research Software
Development
Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it/research-software).
Besides this, I am an active contributor to many free and open-source projects,
mainly related to scientific computing and written in
[Julia](https://julialang.org/).  I am also co-maintainer of [GNU
AUCTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/).
