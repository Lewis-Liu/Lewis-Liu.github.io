# Add new post!
- Open GitHub Desktop app. Select folder where to save your repository **Lewis-Liu.github.io**.
- Create new document in Texts, type something, and save it into **_posts** folder of the repository. File should be named as a date followed by post title, with words separated by dashes, for example: **2021-06-08-test.md**.


# Tips and tricks
- Feel free to remove existing .md files in _posts directory.
- Donâ€™t forget to commit changes in GitHub Desktop and sync them to GitHub.
- Save images into **images** folder of the repository, then insert into documents in Texts. The path to image should start with **../images/** in order to work correctly both in Texts and on the web site.
- If the site is not updated after you sync commits to GitHub check email for any error reports.
